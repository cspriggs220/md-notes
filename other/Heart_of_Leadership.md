        - By NOT taking action, you're allowing other things to take place (potentially negative)
    "Your missed opportunities are often no big deal in isolation. They are, however, cumulative."
    "Because leaders develop a habit of responding with courage, **they have to be told what to do less often**"
"If not me, then who?"

## Chapter 6: The Price of Leadership

"Leadership character, like other character traits, once established, is hard to hide"

## Study Questions

Think of a time you were courageous as a leader. Answer the following questions...
    
What was the situation?

- Since mine is more about initiating something on a interpersonal-level, mine is tied to leading my siblings to connect with each other on a weekly basis to encourage us to deepen our relationships since we don't get together in-person.

Why did the outcome matter?

- We'd either become more involved in each other's lives or we would slowly but surely drift even further apart

How did your action affect the outcome?

- I did something about the problem, and at least in the small amount of time we've been connecting, I'd say that the results have born fruit at least in that my brother and I get to see each other every week and connect.

What did you learn about yourself?

- That my ideas can make a difference

Brainstorm 20 different situations in which courage is required.

- Responding to an emergency (work/home)
- Opposing opinion on direction for a thing/project/idea
- It takes courage to be somewhat obstinant/standing up and opposing something you feel passionately about

Reference: 12 Angry Men - group think and opposing ideas
