## Wins for our RS Teams

1. ELP's SmartVestor render time jumped up 34% and immediately notified Daniel and the Front-End team. Was able to narrow it down and find out the offending code (Optimizely). They were able to take that 3rd Party (internal) issue up to the Shared Solutions team's attention and get it resolved very quickly. The notification helped point out a **performance degradation** that might have otherwise gone unnoticed for long time (or forever).

1. Un-optimized image asset made it to production and the team was notified of the increase in a page weight of ~30%.

## Viability

- _Approved_ by Procurement and is in our technology toolkit!
- Currently ELP is paying $20/mo for 2,000 "checks" **CHEAP**
- Longterm goal of integration withing the GO deployment pipelines
- Could be great for our revenue-generating pages
- Could provide **great insight** to our marketing team and the rest of the business as we can use benchmark comparisons against competitors, or just for sheer team-wide insight from a tech perspective.
